Not envious of the immortals.
Life if only as first seen, what the autumn wind sad painting fan.
Once there was a sincere love in front of me, I did not cherish, until after the loss of reg-
ret. If God gives me another chance to come again, I will say three words to that girl: I lo-
ve you. If you have to add a deadline to this love, I hope it is: ten thousand years.
